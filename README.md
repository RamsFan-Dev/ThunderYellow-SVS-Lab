## Bug reporting

Describe your ROM test build (for example, Test 125N), Delta or other emulator version, the in-game location, what went wrong, and the exact steps to reproduce the issue. Attach your broken `.svs` file inside a `.zip` archive (up to 25 MB). Screenshots and multiple states from a single test sequence are welcome. **Do not upload a full copyrighted .gba ROM.**

## SVS Lab v2.23 — Pokémon storage and trainer funds

The [SVS Lab editor](https://ramsfan-dev.github.io/ThunderYellow-SVS-Lab/) now includes:

1. **Add all supported species:** Open a verified Delta `.svs`, select **PC boxes**, expand **Add one of every available in-game Pokémon**, choose a level, and confirm. The editor adds missing species from the **386-species Generation III Pokédex** into **empty** PC slots without replacing your party or existing Pokémon. It blocks the operation when storage is insufficient or live and saved storage are inconsistent.
2. **Bill's PC management:** Select **PC boxes (14)** to edit any boxed Pokémon directly. Use **All PC Pokémon by Pokédex number** for a non-destructive sorted view; **Sort actual PC boxes by Pokédex #** permanently rearranges the PC slots in the exported state, after confirmation. Boxed Pokémon can already be edited, copied, moved or deleted individually.
3. **Gender:** Choose **Male**, **Female**, or the species-supported fixed/genderless option for a selected Pokémon; gender is derived from the Gen III personality ID and changes preserve the existing nature and shiny setting. The **original starter Pikachu is protected**.
4. **Cash:** Change Pokédollars up to **999,999**, alongside the existing Casino Coins field. Wallet writes use the 32-bit FireRed encryption key and update verified FLASH/live RAM mirrors.

**Important testing instructions:** Back up the original `.svs` **and** your normal in-game `.sav`. Export the edited state as a **new** file, import it into the **same exact ROM version** in Delta, and choose **Load State**. Loading **Continue** reads the separate in-game `.sav` and will not show SVS-only edits. These new functions have passed static JavaScript, Gen III record, source-layout and sample-save consistency checks, but are **not yet gameplay verified in Delta**. Try a single box edit and cash change before using the bulk operations.

## Existing SVS Lab

The existing browser-based Delta SVS editor is preserved in the repository's root `index.html`. It runs locally in your browser with no upload server or external libraries. Save states are tied to the exact ROM version; the editor does not repair ROM follower startup code.

## Current gameplay-testing reference

Test 125N has passed Pikachu Surf/shore transitions and battle follow-up checks in user gameplay testing. Future issues can be tracked independently in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/RamsFan-Dev/ThunderYellow-SVS-Lab/issues).
